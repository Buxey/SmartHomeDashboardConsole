# SmartHome Dashboard Console

This is a Smart Home Dashboard Console project that we had been given as coursework for our programming module using Java, but upon finding Java & OOP extremely difficult (just barely getting my pass), I decided to redo the coursework again during the summer to make sure to the best of my ability I understood OOP principles.

The project itself is a SmartHome Dashboard that builds and managaes all the different rooms and smartplugs that a room would have been given. for example a room being given a device of TV and being able to turn that TV on or off or being able to move it to another room. 

if you would like to take a further look at my project please view the files that have been uploaded

Any feedback is welcome

Thanks!
